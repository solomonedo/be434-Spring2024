In this class, we will use channels for conversations and questions related to set up, homework, and python in general. I also created a \"general\" channel for questions about the class, and \"random\" for anything else you want to discuss! Think of channels like small meetings open to anyone, where you can get help, and also help each other. In channels, anyone can ask questions or submit ideas.\n",

    "Channels can also be easily be searched by anyone in our workspace. So if you have a question, you can see if it has already been asked/discussed elsewhere.

Everyone benefits from seeing all of the context of the conversation and feel free to chime in when you know the answer!\n",
